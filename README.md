- **CSS Modules** – Scoped styling for React components (e.g., `About.module.css`) to avoid style conflicts.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core programming language for logic and component structure.
- **Asset Management** – Images and icons are organized in the `assets/` folder and referenced in components.
